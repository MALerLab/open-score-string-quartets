This additional file/directory serves to provide the full, fragmentary evidence across the whole work.

When it is not possible to prepare a performable score in its entirety for the musescore.com collection,

For further discussion, see the [DLfM paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3625135.3625155) which served to announce the official release of OSQ.
