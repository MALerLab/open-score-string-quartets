# .gitattributes - Tell Git how to handle different file formats in the repo.

# Unrecognized formats: Let Git decide whether the file is text or binary.
# If text, checkout system line endings (or follow `git config core.eol`).
# If binary, don't mess with line endings (avoid corrupting the file).
